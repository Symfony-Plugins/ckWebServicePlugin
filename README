# ckWebService plugin (for symfony 1.1)

The `ckWebServicePlugin` is a symfony plugin that let you expose your modules and actions as a webservice.

The Plugin is based on the standard PHP SOAP module, see [http://de.php.net/manual/en/ref.soap.php](http://de.php.net/manual/en/ref.soap.php).

It offers automatic generation of .wsdl files from your source code, using a WSDL Generator (ckWsdlGenerator).

## Installation
  
To install the latest release:

    > symfony plugin:install ckWebServicePlugin
  
or to install the current revision, checkout the HEAD revision into a ``plugins/ckWebServicePlugin`` folder:
  
    > svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/ckWebServicePlugin/trunk

Now configure the plugin how it is described in the next section and clear your cache.

## Configuration

The plugin configuration is split over several yml files, some settings are mandatory others are optional and should only be set if you want to change the default behavior.

### app.yml

Configure general plugin settings.
  
    # your enviroment for web service mode
    soap:
      # enable the `ckSoapParameterFilter` [mandatory]
      enable_soap_parameter: on
      ck_web_service_plugin:
        # the location of your .wsdl file, relative to the web/ folder [mandatory]
        wsdl: myWebService.wsdl 
        # the class that will be registered as handler for webservice requests [optional]
        handler: ckSoapHandler
        # set the persistence mode [optional]
        persist: %SOAP_PERSISTENCE_SESSION%
        # set wether or not action views should be rendered as normal [optional]
        render: off
        # set the custom method every action class implements to get the result of the action [optional]
        result_callback: getSoapResult
        # the options array, which is passed to the `SoapServer` constructor, is the same as described in the php soap documentation [optional]
        soap_options:
          encoding: utf-8
          soap_version: %SOAP_1_2%
        # register your SoapHeaders and their corresponding data container class [optional]
        soap_headers:
          FooHeader:                     # name of the soap header
            class: MyFooHeaderDataClass  # name of the data class
          BarHeader:
            class: MyFooHeaderDataClass

### module.yml

>**TIP**
>The configuration described here is done by the WSDL Generator!
  
The plugin allows per action configuration of parameters passed by the soap call so you can use them like request parameters.
Also you can configure per action in which action member the result is stored, if not set ``result`` is assumed, and wether or not to render the view as result.

    # your enviroment for web service mode
    soap:
      # the following part added by the WSDL Generator for each action, you only have to configure this if you don't use the generator
      action_name:
        # enable the action to be called from ckWebServiceController, should prevent malicious calls to actions through manipulated soap messages [mandatory]
        enable: true
        # ordered list of the parameters [optional]
        parameter: [first_param, second_param]
        # the name of the action member, which contains the result, if `render` is true this has no effect [optional]
        result: null
        # set wether or not the view should be rendered as normal, if this isn't set the value from `ck_web_service_plugin: render` in `app.yml` is used [optional]
        render: false

### factories.yml

Enable the ``ckWebServiceController``, this is mandatory.

    # your enviroment for web service mode
    soap:
      controller:
        class: ckWebServiceController

### filters.yml

Enable the ``ckSoapParameterFilter``, this is mandatory.

    soap_parameter:
      class: ckSoapParameterFilter
      param:
        # `app_enable_soap_parameter` has to be set to `on` so the filter is only enabled in soap mode
        condition: %APP_ENABLE_SOAP_PARAMETER%

### php.ini

Disable wsdl file caching, when your developing to see changes to the wsdl file instantly, this is optional.

    soap.wsdl_cache_enabled=0

## WSDL Generator (ckWsdlGenerator)

The WSDL Generator offers the possibility to search all your module actions for web service enabled actions and generate a wsdl file with input parameters and return types from the code.
Also it generates yaml configuration for mapping of web service method parameters to request parameters. And lastly generates a controller script, the endpoint of the webservice.
  
Module actions are enabled for export by adding a ``@ws-enable`` to the doc comment block. Also actions have no function parameters you should add ``@param`` and one ``@return`` to each comment block so the web service methods have the proper input and output types.
The Generator allows complex types as input/output values so you can use your classes.
  
The method names of the web service methods follow the scheme: ``module_Action``.
  
The generator is used through the ``webservice:generate-wsdl`` symfony cli task, it has the following syntax:

    > symfony webservice:generate-wsdl [--environment=soap] [--debug=on] app_name webservice_name webservice_base_url
    
It will generate a wsdl file and a controller script in the ``web/`` folder and add / modify all ``module.yml`` files of your actions.

### Example

Howto execute the ``webservice:generate-wsdl`` task shows the following example:
  
    > symfony webservice:generate-wsdl frontend myFooBarService http://www.myfoobar.com/

*   This will add a ``myFooBarService.php`` and a ``myFooBarService.wsdl`` to your ``/web`` folder.

*   The endpoint for the generated service will be ``http://www.myfoobar.com/myFooBarService.php``.
    
Howto enable actions for export shows this example:
  
    [php]
    <?php
    class fooActions extends sfActions
    {
      /**
       * Executes index action
       *
       * @ws-enable
       * @param string $test A string parameter
       *
       * @return string      A string
       */
      public function executeIndex()
      {
        $this->result = 'Parameter $test='.$this->request->getParameter('test');
    
        //return what you want, the view rendering will be bypassed any way
        return sfView::SUCCESS;
      }
    
      /**
       * A method which will not be exposed in the wsdl.
       *
       * @param string $test A string parameter
       *
       * @return string      A string
       */
      public function executeBar()
      {
        $this->something = "some text!";
      }
    }
  
*   This will generate a method with the name ``foo_Index`` with a parameter named ``test`` of type ``string`` and a return value of type ``string``.

>**CAUTION**
>This class has no ``getSoapResult`` method, because the result of the action is stored in the ``result`` member, see 'Internals'->'Getting the action result' for more details.

## sfComponent Extension

To determine if your application is currently in soap mode you can use the ``isSoapRequest()`` method in your component and action classes, to be more precise: in all subclasses of ``sfComponent``.

## SoapHeader

The plugin also supports the use of SoapHeaders. You can use them to send additional data, like authentication data, with a method call.
  
The data a soap header carries is always stored in a complex type, that means you have to specify a class in which the SoapServer can put the incoming data. For compatibility reasons to Microsofts .NET Framework webservice implementation the SoapHeader and the data class need to have the same name.
But fortunatly PHP's ``SoapServer`` implementation allows a mapping of types, defined in the *.wsdl file, to PHP classes. To define these mappings you have to use the ``soap_headers`` setting in ``app.yml``. The keys in this array are always the names of the SoapHeaders. The values are arrays containing a key ``class`` and as value the name of the data class.
This enables you to give SoapHeaders, transporting the same kind of data, different names.
  
The data classes have to be in your project's or application's ``lib/`` folder.
  
To handle incoming headers you have to listen to the ``webservice.handle_header`` event, it is a ``notifyUntil`` event.
The event has two parameters. The first is ``header`` containing the name of the SoapHeader. The second is ``data`` containing an instance of the data class.
If you want to modify the value of the header, use ``$event->setReturnValue($modifiedData)`` where ``$modifiedData`` is an instance of the data class.
  
The following example shows how to process a SoapHeader containing authentication data:
  
  *   The SoapHeader name will be ``SecurityHeader`` and the corresponding data class will be ``AuthData``.
  
  *   Enable the header on a webservice enabled action:
  
        [php]
        <?php
        
        class secureActions extends sfActions
        {
          /**
           * Action to multiply a number with a factor
           *
           * @ws-enable
           * @ws-header SecurityHeader: AuthData
           *
           * @param int $factor
           * @param int $number
           *
           * @return int
           */
          public function executeCalc($request)
          {
            if($this->getUser()->isAuthenticated())
            {
              $this->result = $request->getParameter('factor') * $request->getParameter('number');
            }
            else
            {
              $this->result = null;
            }
          }
        }

>**CAUTION**
>The ``@param`` doctag for the ``$request`` parameter is removed so it is not exported by the WSDL Generator.

  *   Add the following lines to the ``app.yml`` file:

        # your enviroment for web service mode
        soap:
          ck_web_service_plugin:
            # the rest of the plugin config
            # ...
            soap_headers:
              SecurityHeader:
                class: AuthData
  
  *   Create an ``AuthData.class.php`` file in your application's ``lib/`` folder, this will be the data class for the header.
  
        [php]
        <?php
        
        /**
         * AuthData stores authentication data send with a SoapHeader.
         */
        class AuthData
        {
            /**
             * Flag wether the authentication succeded.
             *
             * @var bool
             */
            public $success;
        
            /**
             * The user name.
             *
             * @var string
             */
            public $name;
        
            /**
             * The user password.
             *
             * @var string
             */
        	public $pass;
        }
  
  *   Register an event listener in your application's configuration class and create the listener class in your application's ``lib/`` folder.
  
    *   Modified application's configuration class:
    
            [php]
            <?php
            
            class appConfiguration extends sfApplicationConfiguration
            {
              public function configure()
              {
                $this->dispatcher->connect('webservice.handle_header', array('SecurityHeaderListener', 'listenToWebserviceHandleHeaderEvent'));
              }
            }
    
    *    Create a ``SecurityHeaderListener.class.php`` file in your application's ``lib/`` folder, this will be the event listener class:
    
            [php]
            <?php
            
            /**
             * SecurityHeaderListener listens to the webservice.handle_header event for the SecurityHeader.
             */
            class SecurityHeaderListener
            {
              const HEADER_NAME = 'SecurityHeader';
            
              /**
               * Handles a webservice.handle_header event, if the header is of type SecurityHeader.
               *
               * @param sfEvent $event A sfEvent instance.
               */
              public static function listenToWebserviceHandleHeaderEvent(sfEvent $event)
              {
                if($event['header'] == self::HEADER_NAME)
                {
                  $return = null;
                  
                  if($event['data']->name == 'test' && $event['data']->pass == 'test')
                  {
                    $return = clone $event['data'];
                    $return->success = true;
                    sfContext::getInstance()->getUser()->setAuthenticated(true);
                  }
              
                  $event->setReturnValue($return);
              
                  return true;
                }
                else
                {
                  return false;
                }
              }
            }

## Internals

The next three sections should give an inside view of the plugin architecture.

### ckSoapHandler

The ``ckSoapHandler`` class is the default web service request handler class. Because just since PHP 5.2 a method ``SoapServer::setObject(...)`` exists, which allows to set a object, which will handle requests, so to support older versions the ``SoapServer::setClass(...)`` is used.
Because there should only be one instance of ``ckWebServiceController`` a helper class ``ckSoapHandler`` is defined, which just passes the requests back to the controller instance. This mechanism only works if you use method names of scheme ``module_Action``.
If you want to use custom web service method names see section 'Custom RequestHandler'.

### ckSoapParameterFilter

Usually action method definitons (``execute*``) have no input parameters, instead data is aquired through ``getRequestParameter(...)`` method. In contrast to web service methods real parameters are passed.
In conclusion we have to provide a mapping of function parameters to request parameters. This is done by the 'ckSoapParameterFilter' it takes the names of the request parameters from the corresponding ``module.yml``.
The names in the configuration have to be in the same order like the function arguments. 
  
In general an array containing all params can be retrieved by: ``$request->getParameter('param', null, 'ckWebServicePlugin');``.

### Getting the action result

There are multiple stages of getting the action result. First we try to invoke an implementation of the ``result_callback`` configured in ``app.yml``.
If none is found on the action instance a default getter is mixed into the action and is called. In this version this is down by listening to the ``component.method_not_found`` event. 
  
This default getter has the following behavior:

*   when rendering is enable for the action (depending on configuration in ``module.yml`` and ``app.yml``):
  *   the rendered view is returned
*   when rendering is disabled:
  *   if only one variable exists in the actions parameter holder (set via ``$actionInstance->var = 'some value';``), this variable is returned
  *   if a default key into the parameter holder is configured using ``soap_return_key`` in the ``module.yml`` (if this is not configured ``result`` is assumed) and this key exists, its corresponding value is returned
  *   if both approaches fail nothing is returned 

The described mechanism should be an easy to use, but powerfull way for you to get the result of an action.

## Custom RequestHandler

If the method names of scheme ``module_Action`` are to abstract for you or you have already a wsdl file I recommend to implement your own handler class.  Don't forget to set this new handler class in ``app.yml``.

### Example

The following example assumes you have a wsdl with a web service method named ``descriptiveFooMethod`` and two parameters ``foo`` and ``bar``. And a call to this should be redirected to the action ``index`` in the module ``fooModule``.

    [php]
    <?php
    class mySoapHandler
    {
      public function descriptiveFooMethod($foo, $bar)
      {
        return sfContext::getInstance()->getController()->invokeSoapEnabledAction('fooModule', 'index', array($foo, $bar));
      }
    }

If you have configured the ``module.yml`` of the ``fooModule`` in the following way:
  
    # your enviroment for web service mode
    soap:
      index:
        enable: true
        parameter: [foo, bar]
  
parameter mapping will work like you expect it.

## TODO

*   decide how to handle redirects
*   write tests
*   enable nusoap, PEAR::SOAP as soap_server
